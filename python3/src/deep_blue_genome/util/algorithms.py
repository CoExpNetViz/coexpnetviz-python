# Outperformed all other algorithms on python3.4 on a wide range of inputs

def merge_overlapping_named_sets(sets):
    '''
    Merge named sets that overlap.
    
    Merge sets that overlap, keep other sets unchanged. 
    
    >>> merge_overlapping_named_sets([({'a'}, {1,2}), ({'b'}, set()), ({'c'}, {2,3}), ({'d'}, {4,5,6}), (set(), {6,7})])
    [({'a','c'}, {1,2,3}), ({'d'}, {4,5,6,7})]
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    sets : iterable of (names : {any}, values : {any})
        `names` is a set of names assigned to the set, `values`. Tuples with
        empty `values` will be ignored (and will not appear in the output).
        `names` may be the empty set and may show up in the output.
    
    Returns
    -------
    iterable of (names : {any}, values : {any})
        Order of input tuples in `sets` might not be preserved.
