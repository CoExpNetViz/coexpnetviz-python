# Do not edit this file, instead override the defaults in a configuration file,
# optionally using this file as a template. See the help message of any 
# Deep Blue Genome (DBG) command line tool, e.g. `dbg-morph -h`, for a list of locations
# where DBG looks for configuration files.
#
# For descriptions of the options, see the help message of the corresponding
# command/interface, e.g. `dbg-morph -h` for [morph]. 
#
# Sections (denoted by [section_name]) override the options
# listed under [default] for the interface corresponding to the section name.
# E.g. to override an option for MORPH, put it underneath the [morph] section.
#
# You can also add options specific to the interface underneath its section,
# e.g. specify top_k for MORPH.
#
# Key names (left hand side of =) are case-insensitive and consider '-', '_' and ' ' as equivalent.
# So these are equivalent:

#     tmp-dir = value
#     tmp dir = value
#     Tmp dir = value
