   Chicken Turtle Util (CTU) provides an API of various Python utility functions.
   
   Chicken Turtle Util is alpha. None of the interface is stable (yet), meaning it
   may change in the future.
   
   Chicken Turtle Util offers a variety of features, as such we kept most
   dependencies optional.  When using a module, add/install its dependencies,
   listed in its corresponding ``*_requirements.in`` file found in the root of the
   project; e.g.  `cli_requirements.in`__ lists the dependencies of
   `chicken_turtle_util.cli`.
